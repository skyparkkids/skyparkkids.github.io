      <p>Allow children and teens (1 - 16). We want to make sure each and every guest
        is having fun, but more importantly, also being safe. Court Guards are there to
        monitor our policies and rules, which are in place in order to ensure the safety
        of everyone.</p>
      <ul className="list-group">
        <li className="list-group-item active">Please be aware of our general rules:</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>Every person
          who jumps on our trampolines must first provide a valid/signed SkyparkKids
          waiver.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>Those under 18 must have the waiver signed by their parent or legal guardian.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>Do not jump if you have any health limitations.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>Grip socks are
          required. Grip socks help prevent slipping and falling against the smooth
          surfaces of trampolines. You may bring your own or they can be purchased, which
          are reusable and yours to keep. We do not allow jumping with bare feet due to
          hygienic reasons.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>The Jump & Play
          pass gives you access to the toddler section and the trampoline court.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>The equipment
          and activities in the toddler section are strictly for children 54" and under.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>Parents can be
          in the toddler area. However, they cannot be inside or on any of the equipment
          due to safety reasons.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>Only those with
          a valid time sticker may be on the equipment (trampoline area and toddler
          section).</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>No double
          bouncing. No double flips or flips or tricks over the pads. Single flips are
          permitted but no more than 2 in a row.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>No pushing, running, racing, horseplay, or wrestling on the trampolines.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>Only attempt flips and tricks that are within your comfort zone.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>No sitting,
          laying, or resting on the trampolines or the pads. If you need to take a break,
          you can rest on the platforms or in the waiting area.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>No pulling or
          hanging on the top pads. Always jump and land on two feet and never jump or land
          on the padding. Never land on your head.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>No belt
          buckles, clothing studs, jewelry, key chains, or sharp objects are permitted on
          the trampolines.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>No cameras,
          phones, glasses, or any other hard devices are allowed on the trampolines.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>No food, gum,
          or drinks on the trampolines. Customers may not have anything in their mouths
          (gum, candy, etc.) while on the trampolines.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>Adhere to these
          rules and additional rules which are posted on site for featured areas of the
          park.</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>Trampolining is
          an inherently dangerous activity. Jump at your own risk. Please follow all
          SKYPARKKIDS rules and listen to the Court Guards. This list is not inclusive and
          subject to change</li>
        <li className="list-group-item"><i className="fas fa-star mr-2"/>Guests who fail
          to abide by facility rules and policies will lose their jump time without
          reimbursement.</li>
